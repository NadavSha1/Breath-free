# Standalone Migration Summary

This document summarizes the changes made to convert the BreatheFree app from a Base44-dependent application to a fully standalone application.

## Changes Made

### 1. Removed Base44 SDK Dependency
- Removed `@base44/sdk` from package.json dependencies
- Deleted `src/api/base44Client.js`

### 2. Created Mock Implementations
- **`src/api/mockAuth.js`**: Mock authentication system that auto-authenticates users
- **`src/api/mockEntities.js`**: Mock entity management using localStorage for data persistence
- **`src/api/mockIntegrations.js`**: Mock integrations including LLM responses for craving support

### 3. Updated API Layer
- **`src/api/entities.js`**: Now imports from mock implementations instead of Base44 SDK
- **`src/api/integrations.js`**: Now imports from mock implementations instead of Base44 SDK

### 4. Fixed Import Issues
- Fixed import paths in `src/pages/Layout.jsx` for coffee support components
- Simplified date-fns locale handling in `src/pages/Awards.jsx` to avoid dynamic imports

### 5. Updated Configuration
- Changed app name from "base44-app" to "breathefree-app"
- Updated version to 1.0.0
- Updated HTML title and favicon references
- Updated README.md with standalone instructions

### 6. Added Production Serving
- Created `serve.js` for production deployment
- Added `npm run serve` script
- Added express as a dev dependency

## Key Features of Standalone Version

### Data Storage
- All data is stored in browser localStorage
- No external API calls or dependencies
- Data persists across browser sessions
- Completely private and offline

### Authentication
- Auto-authentication on first use
- Mock user profile with demo data
- No callback domain issues

### Functionality
- All original features maintained
- Mock LLM responses for craving support
- Statistics and achievements work with local data
- Coffee support popup system intact

## Running the Application

### Development
```bash
npm install
npm run dev
```

### Production
```bash
npm run build
npm run serve
```

## Benefits of Standalone Version

1. **No External Dependencies**: Runs completely offline
2. **Privacy**: All data stays on user's device
3. **No Authentication Issues**: No callback domain errors
4. **Easy Deployment**: Can be served from any static file server
5. **Fast Performance**: No API calls mean instant responses
6. **Reliability**: No network dependencies mean no downtime

The application now works independently without requiring any Base44 infrastructure or authentication setup.
